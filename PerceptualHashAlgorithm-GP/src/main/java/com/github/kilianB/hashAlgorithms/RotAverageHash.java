 * alt="Ring partition. Pixels are nmapped to buckets according to their
 * distance to the center">
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each bucket corresponds to a single pixel which means that the rescaled image
 * gets rather large when higher bit resolutions are required which affects the
 * performance for high bit keys lengths.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: Unlike the other hashing algorithms this algorithm is only thread safe
 * after it successfully hashed it's first image. If concurrent usage is
 * required perform a single hash pass on an arbitrary image.
