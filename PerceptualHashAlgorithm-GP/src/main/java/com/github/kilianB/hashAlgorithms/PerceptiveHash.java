/**
 * Calculate a hash based on the frequency of an image using the DCT T2. This
 * algorithm provides a very good accuracy and is robust to several image
 * transformations, usually providing much better distinction capability than
 * color or gradient based approaches.
 * <p>
 * Due to the nature of dct's the hashes generated by this algorithms bits do
 * not have a 50% chance of being set resulting in the normalized hamming
 * distance usually not covering the entire [0-1] range.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Implnote:</b> In future versions this issue can possibly be addressed by
 * applying principal component analysis on a huge set of hashes and figuring
 * out which bits are holding the most information. Maybe we can fix this by
 * taking a look at the difference to a fixed cosine.
 * <p>
 * A lot of implementations around also compute the hash based on the mean value
 * and not the mean. Take a look at this as well.
