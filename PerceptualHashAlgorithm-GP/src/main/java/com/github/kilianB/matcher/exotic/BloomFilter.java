/**
 * A bloom filter is an approximative data structure with constant space and
 * time guarantee to check if an image is likely in the set or definitely not
 * present.
 * <p>
 * False positives are possible, false negatives are not. In other words, if the
 * bloom filter decides that an element is not present it wasn't added
 * beforehand with absolute certainty.
 * <p>
 * Images are mapped by multiple hash functions. Contrary to other matchers the
 * bloom filter checks against images with the <b>exact</b> same hash in
 * constant time making it a good candidate to filter before initiating more
 * expensive operations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If image duplicates shall be avoided different hash functions with high bit
 * resolutions are to be chosen.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While a check on image similarity isn't possible by traditional bloom filter
 * using a very low bit hash function, will result in images with small
 * deviation being hashed to the same bucket with higher possibility allowing
 * for further investigation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The supplied hashing algorithms are only used to seed a
 * {@link com.github.kilianB.pcg.Pcg Pcg} Random Number Generator and are
 * chained back to back to each other if more hash functions are required than
 * got provided by the user to ensure the target false positive probability.
 * <p>
 * If more algorithms are provided as can be used these algorithms will be
 * discarded with a notice in the console/logger.
